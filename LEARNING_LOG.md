## Day 2 - [Fecha de hoy] - HashMap Internals
⏱️ **Time:** 45 min | 🎯 **Focus:** HashMap internal implementation

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
1. **Hash Function** - Convierte keys en array indices: `key.hashCode() % capacity`
2. **Collision Handling** - LinkedList en buckets, Tree cuando >8 elementos
3. **Load Factor 0.75** - Balance óptimo space/time, trigger resize en 75% capacity
4. **Resize Process** - Ocurre cuando size > capacity × loadFactor, duplica capacity
5. **Performance** - O(1) average lookup vs ArrayList O(n) linear search

### 💡 "Aha!" Moments
- HashMap colisiones NO rompen funcionalidad, solo se manejan elegantemente
- O(1) lookup es game-changer para Employee ID searches
- "AaAa" y "BBBB" mismo hashCode but different buckets → collision demo real
- Load factor 0.75 es matemáticamente óptimo, no número aleatorio
- Mi Employee System = perfect use case para HashMap vs ArrayList

### 🔗 Connections Made
- Links to: [[Collections Framework]], [[Big O Notation]], [[Employee Management System]]
- Applies to: Database indexing patterns, lookup table optimization
- Performance patterns: Trade-off prevention vs handling, constant vs linear time

### 🛠️ Practical Implementation
- ✅ Implemented HashMap CRUD operations
- ✅ Explored hash collision behavior with real code
- ✅ Built Employee lookup system demonstrating O(1) performance
- ✅ Compared HashMap vs ArrayList performance characteristics

### ❓ Questions to Explore Tomorrow
- ¿Cómo Streams API procesará HashMap data efficiently?
- ¿Cuándo usar TreeMap vs HashMap vs LinkedHashMap?
- ¿Cómo custom hashCode() para Employee objects?

### 📊 Self-Assessment
- **Understanding:** 5/5 (concepts crystal clear, formulas memorized)
- **Practical Application:** 5/5 (can implement from scratch confidently)
- **Retention Confidence:** 5/5 (active recall test 5/5, strong connections)

### 🎯 Tomorrow's Preview
- **Topic:** Streams API Basic Operations
- **Connection:** "Streams will process my HashMap Employee data with filter/map/collect operations"
- **Bridge:** "HashMap gives me O(1) storage, Streams give me powerful processing"


## Day 3 - [Fecha de hoy] - Streams API Basic Operations
⏱️ **Time:** 45 min | 🎯 **Focus:** Stream pipeline processing for Employee data

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
1. **Stream Pipeline** - Source → Intermediate Operations → Terminal Operation
2. **Filter Operations** - `.filter(emp -> condition)` for Employee selection by criteria
3. **Map Operations** - `.map(Employee::getName)` for type transformations
4. **Collect Operations** - `.collect(Collectors.toList())` Stream → Collection conversion
5. **Method Chaining** - Readable declarative pipelines vs imperative loops

### 💡 "Aha!" Moments
- Stream pipeline reads like English: "Get names of engineers earning >60k"
- Lazy evaluation: intermediate operations don't execute until terminal operation
- OptionalDouble from average() handles empty collections gracefully
- HashMap.values().stream() perfect bridge from yesterday's O(1) storage to powerful processing
- Complex Employee queries become one-liners with proper chaining

### 🔗 Connections Made
- Links to: [[Day 2 - HashMap Internals]], [[Employee Management System]], [[Functional Programming]]
- Builds on: HashMap O(1) storage + Stream O(n) processing = optimal Employee system
- Pipeline thinking: Source data → transformations → final result
- Declarative > Imperative: Say WHAT you want, not HOW to do it

### 🛠️ Practical Implementation
- ✅ Built Employee filtering by department and salary thresholds
- ✅ Implemented name extraction with map() transformations
- ✅ Created complex queries: engineers earning above average salary
- ✅ Compared Streams vs traditional loops readability
- ✅ Applied groupingBy() for department analysis
- ✅ Used OptionalDouble.orElse() for safe average calculations

### ❓ Questions to Explore Tomorrow
- ¿Cómo usar Collectors.groupingBy() para advanced Employee analytics?
- ¿Cuándo usar parallelStream() para performance boost?
- ¿Cómo crear custom Collectors para business-specific metrics?

### 📊 Self-Assessment
- **Understanding:** 5/5 (pipeline concept crystal clear, syntax natural)
- **Practical Application:** 5/5 (complex Employee queries implemented successfully)
- **Retention Confidence:** 5/5 (strong connection to Employee System, readable code)

### 🎯 Tomorrow's Preview
- **Topic:** Collectors Advanced (groupingBy, partitioningBy)
- **Connection:** "Advanced Collectors will enable Employee analytics and reporting dashboards"
- **Bridge:** "Basic Streams give me processing power, Advanced Collectors give me business insights"

## Day 4 - [Fecha de hoy] - Collectors Advanced (groupingBy, partitioningBy)
⏱️ **Time:** 45 min | 🎯 **Focus:** Advanced collectors for Employee business intelligence

### 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
1. **Collectors.groupingBy()** - Group by criteria into Map<Key, List<Value>> for multiple categories
2. **Collectors.partitioningBy()** - Binary split into Map<Boolean, List<Value>> for true/false conditions
3. **Downstream Collectors** - counting(), averagingDouble(), summarizingDouble() for post-grouping processing
4. **Statistical Collectors** - Complete analytics with min/max/avg/count in single operation
5. **Multi-level Grouping** - Nested collectors for complex business dimensions
6. **Optional Handling** - Safe max/min operations with .isPresent() checks

### 💡 "Aha!" Moments
- partitioningBy() more efficient than groupingBy() for boolean conditions
- Downstream collectors enable one-liner business analytics queries
- DoubleSummaryStatistics gives complete salary analysis per department
- Multi-level grouping creates nested business intelligence maps
- Optional handling prevents crashes in statistical operations
- Complex Employee dashboard queries readable as English sentences
